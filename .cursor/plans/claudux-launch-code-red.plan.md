# claudux — CODE RED: launch the drift-gate re-center

**Status:** ACTIVE · **Authority:** this file is the sole mission authority · **Repo:** `firstbitelabsllc/claudux` (canonical public) · **Trunk:** `origin/main`

## Mission (one line)

Drive claudux from "re-centered + drift gate landed on `origin/main` (#85, `2d1f872`)" to "the drift gate is dogfooded in claudux's OWN CI, proven on a second real repo, and 1.2.0 is published" — ranking real launch-credibility risk first, landing by the repo's normal branch/PR rule, never spinning on a human gate.

## What is already TRUE on origin/main (grounded 2026-07-19, ref `origin/main` = `2d1f872`)

- `lib/drift.sh` — deterministic comparator, wired: `REQUIRED_LIBS` includes `drift.sh`; `"drift")` case in `bin/claudux:375` calls `claudux_drift`.
- `docs-drift-lock.json` — committed baseline (`baseline=269cafb`), un-ignored.
- `tests/test-drift.sh` — drift test suite (auto-discovered by `tests/run-all.sh`).
- `.github/workflows/docs-drift.yml` — copy-paste CI job.
- README re-centered: hook "Your build fails the moment a doc starts lying." + drift-verdict banner + terminal-demo SVG + comparison table with staleness row + honest install (source 1.2.0 vs npm 1.1.1).
- GitHub repo "About" description + topics re-centered to the drift positioning (fixed 2026-07-19).
- **Proven live this session** (detached worktree off `origin/main`): `claudux drift` clean → exit 0; surface change to a documented `lib/*.sh` with doc untouched → exit 1, names 6 doc pages + the changed source + the exact fix; restore → exit 0; `--json` emits `{command,sensitivity,baseline,head_sha,ready,drifted[],new_sources[]}`.

## Setup Contract (readiness before deep work)

- **No credentials needed for the core mission** — the gate is keyless, offline, deterministic. This is the entire pitch; never add a network/API dependency to the pass/fail path.
- `npm publish` needs `npm login` (Leo's token) — LEO-GATED, see below.
- Second-repo dogfood needs a target repo already on this machine (e.g. `resplit-ios/.claudux-tool`, `resplit-web`, `strongyes-web`) — no new access required.
- Browser proof uses headless Playwright CLI (`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright`) — already available; claude-in-chrome extension is NOT connected, so do not wait on it.

## P0-first inference (rank by launch-credibility blast radius, not easy-close)

The largest reachable risk to this launch is **"is it actually a real lint or just an AI wrapper?"** Everything that hardens that answer ranks above polish.

### Rows (agent-completable)

| # | Row | Priority | validation |
|---|-----|----------|------------|
| R1 | **Dogfood the gate in claudux's own CI.** `docs-drift.yml` currently ships as an *example*; make the repo actually run `claudux drift` on its own PRs (or confirm it already gates and record the run URL). The credibility money-shot: claudux's own red X on a drifting PR. | P0 | CI run URL showing `claudux drift` executing on a PR; a deliberate drift PR going red, then green after `--accept`/doc-fix. |
| R2 | **Re-baseline the lock to include `lib/drift.sh`.** Current baseline `269cafb` predates `drift.sh`, so every clean run prints a "new source (no baseline)" note for it. Run `claudux drift --accept`, commit the updated `docs-drift-lock.json`, confirm the note clears. | P0 | `claudux drift` exits 0 with an EMPTY `new_sources[]`; committed lock diff is timestamp-free and reviewable. |
| R3 | **Prove the gate on a second REAL repo** (not a fixture). Pick one owned repo on-disk, run `claudux drift --accept` to seed a lock, make a real code+no-doc change, confirm exit 1 names the right doc, restore. Record the transcript. | P0 | exit-code transcript from a non-claudux repo naming the correct doc/source pair. |
| R4 | **Full green gate on `origin/main` HEAD**: `shellcheck`, `tests/run-all.sh`, `tests/test-drift.sh`, `claudux audit --release` (if present), `npm pack --dry-run`. Fix any red. | P0 | pasted pass output of each; any fix lands via branch/PR. |
| R5 | **Wire `--warn-only` pre-commit example + README "Add to CI" polish** only after R1–R4 are green. Verify every doc snippet (CI YAML, pre-commit one-liner) actually runs as written. | P2 | copy-run each snippet; no drift between doc and behavior. |
| R6 | **Browser-render proof**: headless-capture the live GitHub README body and confirm the drift-verdict banner, terminal-demo SVG, and comparison table render (light+dark). | P2 | screenshots read back; note any SVG that fails to render on GitHub's `<img>` sanitizer. |

**P0 inference line (emit every cycle before editing):**
`P0 inference: candidates=[...] selected=<row> because=<largest reachable credibility break> deferred=<why the rest wait>`

Ladder discipline: a green row stopped at `branch_pushed`/`pr_open`/`merged` moves UP the ladder before any new P2 work.

## LEO-GATED handoffs (NOT agent-completable — park as handoffs, never a whole-goal stop)

- **`npm publish` 1.2.0** — needs `npm login` (Leo's token). npm README freezes per version; the re-centered README is already on `main`, so publish is unblocked the moment Leo runs login. Agent prepares `npm pack --dry-run` + a one-command publish recipe; Leo runs it.
- **External posting** (blog / LinkedIn / X) about the re-center — Leo's voice, Leo's call.
- **Restoring the retracted leojkwan.com post / reopening claudux #82** — stay as-is unless Leo says otherwise.

When a cycle finds only LEO-GATED work reachable, it parks with a resume predicate and re-runs P0 inference with those gates excluded — it does NOT mark the mission blocked or complete.

## Progress

- 2026-07-19 — Mission opened. Grounded origin/main (`2d1f872`); proved gate end-to-end (clean→0, drift→1, restore→0, `--json` clean); fixed stale repo description + added drift topics. Collision preflight: 3 legacy claudux automations all stale/complete on old `leojkwan/claudux` remote — no live executor, no collision. PLAN landed via branch/PR.

## Fleet coordination

Single owner per cycle. Fresh-read this PLAN + live claims + `origin/main` before write ownership; claim one unowned row; park conflicts as `waiting_on_owner` and rerank. Checkpoint only on material claim-state change. This is the ONLY executor for this mission; the `cost-100x` provider-control goal is a SEPARATE mission with its own PLAN — do not merge or collide.
